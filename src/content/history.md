<h2>What about the old word Pyrotechny?</h2>

<h3>THE ORIGIN OF PYROTECHNY</h3>

<blockquote>
PYROTECHNY, or the Art of Firework-making, is of great antiquity, and the date of its origin is quite unknown; indeed, it would be impossible to define with any degree of exactitude what actually constitutes a firework.

It is curious how universal is the belief that fireworks were dependent upon the invention or discovery of gunpowder. Very little consideration will prove the fallacy of this view ; in fact, will show that the reverse is probably the case. In India and China saltpetre (or nitrate of potash) is found in large quantities, and was, no doubt, used by the primitive inhabitants in far-off times for such purposes as curing meat, cooking, etc. The dropping of a quantity in the camp fire may have attracted the attention of some early inventor to the extent of starting him on a series of what were probably the earliest chemical experiments.

PYROTECHNICS

Gradually he gives up his hitherto necessary tasks of hunting and trapping, as he receives the fruits of other labours in return for his services as fire-maker to the tribe.

The most important item in early social life is fire, the implements for producing it the most valued property of the tribe ; it was the focus of religion and the centre of daily existence, so that any new phenomenon connected with fire would be of the greatest interest to primitive people, and any short cut to the production of fire would be accorded more perseverance and care in its perfection than almost any other invention.

Fire would be struck with a piece of iron pyrites on a flint, small pieces of reguline particles of iron would be detached and fall on the fire mixture unlit. Afterwards, when combustion of the mass of fire mixture took place, these small pieces of metal would scintillate as do the iron filings in a modern firework composition. This would give rise to a further series of experiments, and gradually the composition known as Chinese Fire would be evolved, which is known to have been in use in the East from remote times.

Having arrived at a pyrotechnic composition, attempt to use it in other ways besides fire-making would naturally follow, and sooner or later the idea of filling the mixture into tubes would suggest itself, especially as both in India and China (in one of which countries pyrotechny undoubtedly originated) a serviceable tube—or to use the modern term “ case ”—was ready to hand in any size or quantity in the ubiquitous bamboo. The bamboo is in use for the purpose at the present day in the East, and until recent times, when displaced by European weapons, was used in the construction of ordnance of considerable size. Mortars used for throwing firework shell up to six or more inches in diameter are still in use in Japan and China, the barrel consisting of a section of 4.

<h3>Pyrotechny the two Greek words for Fire and Art</h3>

<blockquote>
The term Pyrotechny is derived from pyr and techny, the two Greek words for Fire and Art; or it is the art of employing fire for purposes of utility or pleasure. The term has been applied by some writers to the use and structure of fire-arms, and Artillery employed in the art of warfare; but in the present publication, we shall take a different view of the subject; for we can see no amusement in the motion of a bullet, which decimates so many of our fellow-creatures, nor in the action of a bomb-shell, that carries with it more dreadful devastations.

We shall confine ourselves in this Work to a more pleasing application of fire, and endeavour to give plain and efficient rules for the safe management of that element, and for the making, by means of gunpowder, and other inflammable substances, various compositions, agreeable to the eye, both by their form and splendor, and to describe every principal article and instrument made use of in these pleasing operations.

On the other hand, our Work does not pretend to dictate an original set of rules and receipts, for those who term themselves Artists in Fire-works, whose exclusive business it is to manufacture the different articles on which it treats; to those, it is expected it will yield but little instruction; but, to the sciolistic Tyro in the Art, it is intended (as its title expresses) to be a Manual of Pyrotechny, and to treat of fire-works as objects of rational amusement; to describe in a perspicuous manner the materials and apparatus made use of in their construction; and to select such examples of their particular combinations, as are calculated rather for private diversion than public exhibition. The directions herein given (if strictly attended to) will enable youth to gratify their taste for this species of recreation at a comparatively small expense, and at the same time will guard them against those accidents which often arise to the ignorant, in firing the larger works purchased from the makers; and throughout the whole it will strictly observe a principle of economy, the neglect of which has so frequently retarded the operations of genius.

In regard to the origin of Pyrotechny, our knowledge is very limited. The Chinese are said to have been the first people who had any practical knowledge of it, or brought the art to any degree of perfection; with them the use of fire-works is said to have been very general, long before they were known in European countries; and from accounts given of some recent exhibitions at Pekin, it should seem that they have attained to a degree of perfection not surpassed by any of our modern artists: Mr. Barrow, in his “Travels in China” gives, from the Journal of Lord Macartney, the following description of one of their exhibitions: “The fire-works, in some particulars,” says he, “exceeded any thing of the kind I had ever seen. In grandeur, magnificence, and variety, they were, I own, inferior to the Chinese fire-works we had seen at Batavia, but infinitely superior in point of novelty, neatness, and ingenuity of contrivance. One piece of machinery I greatly admired: a green chest, five feet square, was hoisted up by a pulley fifty or sixty feet from the ground, the bottom of which was so contrived as then suddenly to fall out, and make way for twenty or thirty strings of lanterns, inclosed in a box, to descend from it, unfolding themselves from one another by degrees, so as at last, to form a collection of full five hundred, each having a light of a beautifully coloured flame burning brightly within it.
