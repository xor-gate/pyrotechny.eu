It is edited only by members of the Sciencemadness Discussion Board, rather than being open to the public, meaning it is guaranteed to be a collaborative work of home chemists from around the world.

* <a href="https://www.privatedata.com/byb/pyro/pfp/Index.html" class="tip"  target="_blank">Pyrotechnic Formulary Page (PFP)<span>This is a great archive of pyro formulae. Sadly, the author took it down as a result of the actions of a moron (familiar story, unfortunately). On his site he has given permission to others to put it on their sites, which is what I have done as I believe it's a great collection. The original site address is `www.come.to/pfp` If he changes his mind, this is probably where the up to date version will reside in the future. I downloaded this version a couple of years ago, I don't know if a more up to date version exists.

I assume you're here because you share my passion for display pyrotechnics. If not, you're still welcome to browse around, but be forwarned. They say that "He who hath once smelt the smoke is ne'er again free." These pages will teach you a few things about how to create art with light from the combustion of energetic materials. The information is geared for the limited budget amateur who creates his art for the sole purpose of giving delight to his friends and neighbors without thought for commercial gain. Please make yourself at home and be sure to send me a line if you've had a pleasant stay.<br/>Language: English</span></a>

I have three spudguns: a pneumatic gun from How Not To Build An Aircannon, a large combustion gun I made without plans and a smaller gun which is rather strange but works well all the same. <br/>The other reason I made this page is to help people who are just getting started with pyrotechnics.<br/>Language: English</span></a>
