<p>The Preparatory Manual of Black Powder and Pyrotechnics is a new Handbook discussing the world's most commonly used pyrotechnic compositions. The book contains multiple sections dividing the area of pyrotechnics into various levels. Black Powder is the first level, followed by High Performance rocket propellants and gun propellants, then followed by General pyrotechnic compositions. Specialty and Experimental compositions take up the rear, followed by Fireworks. All compositions are discussed in great detail with complete processes for manufacture. The book discusses a total of 1187 pyrotechnic compositions ranging from black powder compositions, to fireworks, to high performance gun propellants, rocket propellants, incendiary agents, smoke producing mixtures, to specialty compositions including cloud seeding compositions, welding compositions, matches, priming compositions, and experimental compositions, all with a variety of uses, and methods of production</p></div>
