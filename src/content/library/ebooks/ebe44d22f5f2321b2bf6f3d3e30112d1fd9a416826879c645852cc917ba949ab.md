## Description<div>
<p>This book covers military pyrotechnics characteristics, sensitivity, combustion, performance parameters, ingredients and their behaviour, various pyrotechnic compositions and their manufacturing methods, filling, pressing and assembly of ammunition and so forth. Divided into two broader sections, namely military pyrotechnic compositions and military pyrotechnic ammunitions and devices, it provides full spectrum of military pyrotechnics and a guide for all personnel involved with management of military pyrotechnic ammunitions and devices in design, production, inspection, training, and use.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul><li>Answers "know what", "know why "and "know how" of pyrotechnic compositions and pyrotechnic ammunitions and devices</li>
<li>Explains various concepts and mechanisms of the military pyrotechnics</li>
<li>Deliberates on role and characteristics of pyrotechnic compositions and its classification</li>
<li>Discusses various factors affecting performance and some differences in military pyrotechnics</li>
<li>Describes various methods of initiation of ignition in ammunition</li>
<li>Elucidates basic requirements of pyrotechnic ammunitions, its development and life cycle of ammunition lots</li>
<li>Provides classification, division, shelf life, compatibility and nomenclature of ammunitions and devices</li>
<li>Reviews test/proof requirements of ammunitions and devices, deployment and functioning, defect classification, sampling plan and acceptance criteria</li>
<li>Explores latest trends in 'green pyrotechnics' for environment- friendly military pyrotechnics</li></ul></div>
