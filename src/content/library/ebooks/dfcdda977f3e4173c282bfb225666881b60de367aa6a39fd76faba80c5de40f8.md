## Description<div>
<p>This book provides chemists with technical insight on pyrotechnics and explosives. It emphasizes basic chemical principles and practical, hands-on knowledge in the preparation of energetic materials. It examines the interactions between and adaptations of pyrotechnics to changing technology in areas such as obscuration science and low-signature flame emission. The updated third edition discusses chemical and pyrotechnic principles, components of high-energy materials, elements of ignition, propagation, and sensitivity. It offers heat compositions, including ignition mixes, delays, thermites, and propellants and investigates the production of smoke and sound as well as light and color.</p></div>
