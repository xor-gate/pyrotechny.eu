## Description<div>
<h3>Product Description</h3>
<p>This concise, easy-to-read book outlines the basic principles needed to understand the chemical mechanisms of explosion. Written for students with no previous knowledge of explosives but some understanding of chemical reactions in mind, it takes the reader through the history of explosives and introduces the concepts of high explosives, propellants and pyrotechnics. </p>
<p>Covering combustion, deflagration, and detonation; ignition, initiation, and thermal decomposition; thermochemistry, thermodynamics and kinetics, the text includes detailed formulations and reactions presented with thermochemical calculations to aid understanding. This edition includes environmental legislation and its impact on explosives, together with a section on safety hazard tests. It also contains the latest developments in synthesis and manufacturing of explosives. </p>
<p>Covering all aspects of the properties of explosives, The Chemistry of Explosives is a unique text which introduces difficult subjects in a readable manner. Ideal for A-level students and new graduates with no previous knowledge of explosive materials, it will also be useful to anyone needing succinct information on the subject, such as the more experienced chemist in the explosives sector.</p>
